# Yggdrasil

[![Build status](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Introduction

Yggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6
network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and
allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with
other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet
connectivity - it also works over IPv4.

## Supported Platforms

Yggdrasil works on a number of platforms, including Linux, macOS, Ubiquiti
EdgeRouter, VyOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OpenWrt.

Please see our [Installation](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation.html)
page for more information. You may also find other platform-specific wrappers, scripts
or tools in the `contrib` folder.

## Building

If you want to build from source, as opposed to installing one of the pre-built
packages:

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org) (requires Go 1.22 or later)
2. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build`

Note that you can cross-compile for other platforms and architectures by
specifying the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, e.g. `GOOS=windows
./build` or `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle ./build`.

## Running

### Generate configuration

To generate static configuration, either generate a HJSON file (human-friendly,
complete with comments):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

... or generate a plain JSON file (which is easy to manipulate
programmatically):

```
./yggdrasil -genconf -json > /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

You will need to edit the `yggdrasil.conf` file to add or remove peers, modify
other configuration such as listen addresses or multicast addresses, etc.

### Run Yggdrasil

To run with the generated static configuration:

```
./yggdrasil -useconffile /path/to/yggdrasil.conf
```

To run in auto-configuration mode (which will use sane defaults and random keys
at each startup, instead of using a static configuration file):

```
./yggdrasil -autoconf
```

You will likely need to run Yggdrasil as a privileged user or under `sudo`,
unless you have permission to create TUN/TAP adapters. On Linux this can be done
by giving the Yggdrasil binary the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.

## Native L3 Routing (Linux)

Yggdrasil now supports native Layer 3 routing on Linux, allowing you to forward arbitrary IPv4 or IPv6 traffic through the mesh without needing additional tunnels.

### How it works
The `tun` module automatically synchronizes with the Linux kernel routing table. When you add a route in the kernel with a **Yggdrasil IPv6 address as the gateway**, Yggdrasil captures this route and programs its internal forwarding table. Any traffic matching these subnets will be encrypted and forwarded directly to the specified Yggdrasil peer.

### Usage Example
Forward a private IPv4 subnet `10.99.99.0/24` to a remote Yggdrasil peer `200:abcd::1`:

```bash
# Add the route to the kernel
# Yggdrasil will automatically detect this and start forwarding traffic
ip route add 10.99.99.0/24 via 200:abcd::1 dev tun0
```

This feature supports **IPv4 over IPv6** (RFC 5549) and standard IPv6 routing. It dramatically simplifies overlay network setups (e.g., DN42) by removing the overhead and MTU issues associated with nested tunnels.
